# Facial-Recognition-Engage22

**Problem Statement :** <br>
Face Recognition Challenge *(To develop a browser-based application to demonstrate the application of Face Recognition technology).*

**Solution :** <br>
Face Recognition web-application which helps to recognize and mark the attendance of the user and can also help in recognizing a fugitive or any missing person. I have also built a **Face Emotions Detector** application which detects the human expressions and display their expression with accuracy.

**Domain :** <br>
AI/ML and Computer-Vision.<br>
*Face Recognition application is developed in python language using Flask framework, with the help of face-recognition and OpenCV modules. And, the Face Emotions Detection page is developed using face API in JavaScript and has been deployed using GitHub Pages.*

## How to run?
First of all, simply download and install all the dependencies required for running this application from **[requirements.txt](https://github.com/KrishChopra22/Facial-Recognition-Engage22/blob/master/Face%20Recognition/requirements.txt)**.
It might be possible that some of the libraries might trouble you during the installation process(sorry but that's the internal error of your IDE).<br> **To fix this issue**, simply download that particular module from the web ( I faced the issue with [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/) and [dlib](https://github.com/KrishChopra22/Facial-Recognition-Engage22/files/8717402/dlib-19.23.1.tar.gz) )<br><br>
Open the terminal and run the following command *(Make sure you are connected to internet)*<br>
`pip install -r /requirements.txt`

Once all the dependencies are installed, now your system is ready to **run** this application ðŸ¥³<br>
Just open [app.py](https://github.com/KrishChopra22/Facial-Recognition-Engage22/blob/master/Face%20Recognition/app.py) on your IDE(VS Code) & **right-click** there and click on **'Run Python File in Terminal'** *as shown below...*

## Run it on the browser :
No need to worry, simply copy the **[link](http://127.0.0.1:5000)** served by your terminal and paste it in the browser.<br>

Most probably, the link would be http://127.0.0.1:5000 <br>
## Some Glimpse, after running on web :

### Now let's go to **Face Emotions Detection** page -

*On some systems, if the video is not being captured(camera is not opening automatically) then go back to the IDE, open the terminal and quit from the server*
**Click on the Terminal & simply press `Ctrl+C`** *(as shown below)*<br><br> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77012237/169136073-8beec9ec-3d18-4b4b-bd79-e2b25bdd65be.png" alt="Quit the Server" width="500"/>

### Reload the page & there you go ðŸ¥³ðŸš€
